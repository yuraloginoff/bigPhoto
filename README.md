# Sliderify

Sliderify is a simple jQuery image slider plugin.

You can see it in action on this [demo page](http://yuraloginoff.com/sliderify/)


## How to install

1. Add CSS to the `<head>`:
```
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/jquery.sliderify.css">
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/theme.css">
```

2. Add JavaScript before the `</body>`:
```
	<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
	<script src="js/jquery.sliderify.js"></script>
	<script>
		$("#slider").sliderify();
	</script>
```

## Markup

The following type of markup structure is needed to make the plugin work:

	<div id="slider">
		<ul>
			<li><img src="img/01.jpg" alt="Image"></li>
		</ul>
	</div>


## CSS
Sliderify plugin is provided with 2 css files: `jquery.sliderify.css` and `theme.css`. You can edit `theme.css` to change default styling. `jquery.sliderify.css` contains some kind of plugin's core so edit it at your own risk.

You should specify image container width: `.slider { width: 500px; }`

Also you can redefine CSS class names. See below.


## JavaScript
Running this script will apply the Sliderify plugin DOM element with a #slider id.
```javascript
$("#slider").sliderify();
```

You can pass an object to sliderify function to redefine default settings, f.i.:
```javascript
$("#slider").sliderify({
	speed : 500,
	transitionEffect : "fade"
});
```

Here is a list of all settings that you can redefine.
